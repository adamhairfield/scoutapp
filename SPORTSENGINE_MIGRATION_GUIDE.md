# SportsEngine Migration System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview

We've successfully built a comprehensive SportsEngine migration system that allows Scout app users to import their teams, players, and data using their existing SportsEngine login credentials. This system uses web scraping instead of requiring API developer accounts.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Migration Screen**: User-friendly interface for credential input and migration progress
- **Scraping Service**: Handles communication with the backend API
- **Migration Service**: Manages data transformation and import to Scout database

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Puppeteer to automate SportsEngine login and data extraction
- **Secure API**: JWT-based authentication and rate limiting
- **Data Processing**: Extracts and formats team/roster data

```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Database Setup
First, run the migration SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of database/add_migration_support.sql
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
nano .env

# Start the backend server
./start.sh dev
```

### 3. Mobile App Configuration
The mobile app is already configured to connect to the backend. Just ensure:
- Backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`
- Mobile app can reach the backend URL
- Database migration has been applied

### 4. Test the Integration
1. Start your Expo development server: `npm start`
2. Open the app and go to Settings → "Import from SportsEngine"
3. Enter valid SportsEngine credentials
4. Preview and migrate data

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Backend Environment Variables
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# Security (IMPORTANT: Change in production!)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# CORS (Update for your app)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:19006,exp://localhost:19000

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_POINTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_DURATION=60
```

### Mobile App Configuration
The backend URL is automatically configured based on environment:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Production**: Set in `app.json` under `extra.sportsEngineBackend.production`

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters SportsEngine credentials in the mobile app
2. **Authentication**: Backend uses Puppeteer to log into SportsEngine
3. **Data Extraction**: Backend scrapes organization, team, and roster data
4. **Data Preview**: Mobile app displays what will be migrated
5. **Migration**: User confirms and data is imported to Scout database
6. **Completion**: User can access their migrated teams in Scout

## 🔒 Security Features

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Backend connection failed"
- Ensure backend server is running
- Check backend URL configuration
- Verify CORS settings allow your app

#### "Authentication failed"
- Verify SportsEngine credentials are correct
- Check if SportsEngine has changed their login flow
- Review backend logs for detailed errors

#### "No data found"
- Verify user has access to organizations in SportsEngine
- Check if user account has appropriate permissions
- Review scraping selectors if SportsEngine updated their UI

#### "Migration incomplete"
- Check database connection and permissions
- Review migration logs for specific errors
- Ensure sufficient database storage

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging in backend:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=true
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Backend Deployment
1. **Choose hosting provider** (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
2. **Set environment variables** with production values
3. **Configure SSL certificate** for HTTPS
4. **Set up monitoring** and error tracking
5. **Update mobile app** with production backend URL

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Change JWT secret to strong, unique value
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement browser instance pooling
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and optimize
- [ ] Set up load balancing if needed

## 📈 Future Enhancements
